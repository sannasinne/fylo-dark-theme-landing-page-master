## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project I upgraded my Flexbox and overall CSS skills.

### Continued development

In the next project I'm going to use more Grid as I start to be very comfortable with Flexbox already.
